## Aoun-AI – Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Aoun-AI is an advanced AI-powered customer engagement platform designed to streamline communication between businesses and their clients. The platform leverages voice messaging, real-time chat, and AI-driven knowledge base features to deliver fast, accurate, and personalized support.

**Goals:**

- Enable seamless, multi-channel communication (voice, text, chat).
- Empower admins with robust management and analytics tools.
- Integrate AI for smart responses and knowledge retrieval.

**Scope (v1):**

- User authentication, voice messaging, AI chat, admin dashboard, and analytics.

---

## Architecture Overview

Aoun-AI uses a modular, scalable architecture with clear separation between frontend, backend, database, and external APIs.

```mermaid

		A[Frontend (Next.js)] -- API Calls --> B[Backend (Next.js API Routes)]
		B -- DB Queries --> C[(PostgreSQL via Prisma)]
		B -- External Requests --> D[External APIs (OpenAI, Upstash Vector, Stripe, Firebase)]
		A -- Static Assets --> E[CDN / Public Assets]
```

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js, provides the user interface and handles authentication, messaging, and dashboard features.
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes manage business logic, user management, and integrations.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (accessed via Prisma ORM) stores users, messages, knowledge base, and analytics.
- **External APIs:** Integrates with OpenAI for AI responses, Upstash for vector search, Stripe for payments, and Firebase for notifications.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js:**
  - Chosen for its hybrid static/server rendering, fast development, and seamless Vercel deployment.
- **Node.js:**
  - Provides a robust backend runtime for API and server-side logic.
- **Prisma:**
  - Type-safe ORM for efficient, maintainable database access.
- **PostgreSQL:**
  - Reliable, scalable relational database for structured data.
- **OpenAI API:**
  - Delivers AI-powered chat, voice-to-text, and knowledge base features.
- **Upstash Vector:**
  - Enables fast, scalable vector search for semantic knowledge retrieval.
- **Stripe:**
  - Handles secure payment processing and subscription management.
- **Firebase:**
  - Used for real-time notifications and messaging.
- **Vercel:**
  - Provides global, zero-config deployment and CI/CD.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  Secure sign-up, login, and password management using NextAuth.

- **Voice Messaging:**
  Users can record and send voice messages, which are transcribed and processed by AI.

- **AI Chat & Knowledge Base:**
  AI-powered chat with semantic search and knowledge base integration for accurate, context-aware responses.

- **Admin Dashboard:**
  Manage users, content, plans, and system settings with a modern UI.

- **Real-Time Messaging:**
  Instant delivery and receipt of messages using web sockets and Firebase.

- **Analytics & Reporting:**
  Track usage, performance, and user engagement with built-in analytics.

- **Subscription & Payments:**
  Stripe integration for managing user subscriptions and payments.

- **Multi-language Support:**
  Supports multiple languages for a global user base.

## Usage / How It Works

**1. Sign In**

- Go to the platform and click "Sign In".
- Enter your credentials or use a supported social login.

**2. Send a Voice Message**

- Navigate to the chat or dashboard section.
- Click the microphone icon to record your message.
- Press "Send" to submit your voice message.

**3. Receive a Response**

- The system transcribes and processes your message using AI.
- You receive a text or voice response in the chat interface.

**4. Admin Actions**

- Admins can manage users, content, plans, and view analytics from the dashboard.

## Deployment & Environment Variables

- **Deployment:**
  The project is deployed on Vercel for global scalability and reliability.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `DATABASE_URL` – PostgreSQL connection string
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` – OpenAI API key
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` – NextAuth secret for authentication
  - `STRIPE_API_KEY` – Stripe integration key
  - `FIREBASE_API_KEY` – Firebase API key
  - `UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL` – Upstash Vector endpoint
  - `UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN` – Upstash Vector token
  - `[Add any additional keys as needed]`

> All environment variables are securely stored and never exposed to the public or client-side code.

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Occasional latency (a few seconds) may occur due to external API response times (OpenAI, Upstash).
- Voice recording may have limited browser support on some devices.
- Some features (e.g., multi-language support) may be in beta.
- [Add any additional known issues.]

---

## Next Steps (Roadmap v2)

- Further latency optimization and API response improvements.
- Expand analytics and reporting capabilities.
- Add more integrations (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram).
- Enhance admin controls and user management.
- Broaden multi-language and accessibility support.
- [Add other planned features or improvements.]
